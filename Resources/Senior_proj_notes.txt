Ebike kit
- App interface on phone displays:
* speed
* trip info
* link to default GPS app
*

- LED matrix backplate (alternate POV backplate)
- Additional LED strips along wheels and potentially along bike
- Audio spectrum analyzer of LED strips

- Speedometer
- Odometer saved in app, nonvolatile memory - database
- Buttons automatically start turn signals
- Brakes automatically activate brake light
- Distance sensor to alert biker of cars approaching from behind
- Power adapter 
- Security system?

TA suggestions:
Don't send images over bluetooth? prestore images on board
speed - esp32 MCU with higher speed good for LED

GETTING STARTED ESP32
top:
https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/hw-reference/esp32/get-started-devkitc.html#start-application-development
actual getting started link:
https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html
we did windows, online install

add <esp> folder to your user folder on C drive
then go to step 5
the %IDF_PATH% is wherever your edp-idf folder got installed, mine was desktop
for example I ran: xcopy /e /i ..\Desktop\esp-idf\examples\get-started\hello_world hello_world 

For step 6 go to: https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers
this is the driver you might need if you don't see the MCU in the COM port.
all other things should go smooth


USING ECLIPSE IDE
https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin/blob/master/README.md

lots of stuff goes on here...

ARDUINO IDE setup

best option -
VSCode setup
https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/tutorials/espressif32/espidf_debugging_unit_testing_analysis.html
if project init fails on the ESP-IDF framework, first try adding an exception to your antivirus software.
If that doesn't work try adding the git.exe to the platformIO path within VSCode.
You likely also need an updated python
